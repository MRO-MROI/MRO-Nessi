==================
NESSI --- A How-To
==================

Welcome to *the* NESSI documentation. Here we will strive
to do three things: provide information about the NESSI instrument
itself, explain how to use NESSI and the NESSI software, and show the
inner workings of the NESSI software and electronic components. 


If one wishes to understand the workings and design of NESSI, they
should navigate to :doc:`The Instrument <instrument>`. If one wants to learn how to
use NESSI and the NESSI software, navigate to :doc:`Tutorial <tutorial>`. If one
wishes to understand and debug the NESSI software, they should
navigate to :doc:`Software API <api>`.
