In order to access the thorlabs controllers via pyUSB, the udev rules need to be modified.

Making sure all users are added to the "users" group, I added the following rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/80-thorlabs.rules

ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="faf0", ATTRS{serial}=="83840902",  MODE="0666", GROUP="users", SYMLINK+="ttyREI12"

ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="faf0", ATTRS{serial}=="83841481",  MODE="0666", GROUP="users", SYMLINK+="ttyREI34"

you then have to restart udev (sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart)  and unplug/replug the controllers.

The key parts of these commands are the serial attr, which makes sure the correct controller is identified consistently and associated with the 
correct symlink, either ttyREI12 or ttyREI34.
